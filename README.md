## Overview

We tackle the filtering questionable content in videos, with a focus on detecting comic mischief. While multimodal attention-based models, mainly using hierarchical cross-attention (HCA), have shown competitive performance in this task, we investigate an alternative approach called parallel cross-attention (ParCA) capturing multimodal attention. Additionally, we suggest employing gated multimodal units (GMU) to fuse multiple attention mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancement using ParCA and GMU compared to the HCA-based reference model.
